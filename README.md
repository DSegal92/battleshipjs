### Battleship.js

I've been meaning to learn React.js for a while now, and after having worked
through FB's various introductory materials I decided to work on a few small
projects to solidify the concepts in my mind. I like Battleship as a
programming project because it's a fairly simple game that maps well to a
hierarchical method of problem solving, which I understand to also be one of
React.js's strengths. Also, I'm pretty good at it.

#### What This Is
* An experiment in implementing the game Battleship in React
* A testing ground for some of my more frontend-ish ambitions

#### What this is not
* Functional (currently)
* An attempt to adhere to all of the best practices and standards of the React
  community-- that will come next
* The Magna Carta

#### How to run it
Currently, all of the dependencies are old-school `<link>`ed in `index.html`.
My ambitions for this project extend to figuring out Grunt/ Gulp, or one of
the many other toolchain helpers, but for now that's as complicated as things
have gotten.

I've also written a (currently trivial) reference implementation of a backend
server to handle some of the game logic, which can be found elsewhere in my
repos.
